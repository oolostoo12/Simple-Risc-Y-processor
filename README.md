# Simple-Risc-Y-processor
This project was completed for my Verilog and System Verilog I took in fall 2016. It a simple RISC-Y processor made up of its most fundamental components. It contains ROM, RAM, an ALU, Sequence Controller, data regsiters, and a single IO port. This project is the culminating project of everything done in this class during the semester.
