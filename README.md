# Simple-Risc-Y-processor
This project was completed for my Verilog and System Verilog class I took in fall 2016. It a simple RISC-Y processor made up of its most fundamental components. It contains ROM, RAM, an ALU, Sequence Controller, data regsiters, and a single IO port. This processor has a 4 stage pipeline: Fetch which fetched the instruction the program counter was pointing to, Decoded which decoded the current instruction, Execute which executed the current instruction, and Update which main function lied in branch instructions. If there was a branch instruction then the sequence controller will set the appropriate bits for the program counter to load the instruction as denoted by the branch instruction. If there was no branch instruction, then the processor will proceed as normal by fecthing the next intruction in memory. This project is the culminating project of everything done in this class during the semester.
